# Android Expense Tracker
let me explain why this is literally the best Expense tracking
app for your Android phone you could potentially ever come close to.
First, this has been designed from bottom up just for
Android! That's right, this isn't any lame remake of some 30 years
old windows app that you have seen around the market. It takes full
advantage of the mobility and Android capabilities to really maximize
the fact that it's running on a device that's always with you.  It comes with a
so called 'widget', which a home-screen shortcut that enables you
to control the entire app directly from the home-screen with a single
push of a button. This is especially cool when you're on the move
and want to add an expense really fast. When I started programming
this app I had a purpose in mind, I wanted the app to have powerful 
functions and simultaneously to be as intuitive and simple as possible.
I had a problem with other apps that they were overcomplicated and
even used accounting terms I had trouble to fully understand. While
accounting is one thing, being able to successfully manage one's finance
is not limited to accounting professionals. It's a game
anybody can play. That's why this app uses clear non-technical terms
which are as relevant as easily understandable. What people tell me
they especially like about the app is the intuitiveness, you simply
do what you want to do without having to think about it, it's that
simple! What I am really excited about in this app are the statistics.
The statistics are unique and again super-intuitive. They don't look
like some strange charts you sometimes get to see in other apps. The
statistics here look like music charts! :) That's right, they give
you a graphical 'top-ten' of your spending, beautifully categorized 
in bright colors with percentage for each category. If you track
most of your monthly spending then this chart will give you exact
breakdown of every penny you spent. For example I was really surprised
to see that I spent 14% of my monthly income on gifts alone. Once
you know, you can easily watch yourself and reduce it. So I was
able to reduce the spending by 10% by the end of the next month! It's
fascinating how powerful this simple feedback can be! I really
encourage you to try it out yourself!<br/>
